<h1> Best Open World Games on Nintendo Switch </h1>

<p> 5. at number 5 i am going to put immortals Fenix Rising. 
it was a good game but some of the game mechanics were buggy and 
some of the fights were out of place(too hard, too early on) and 
if im being honest the story wasnt anything to go crazy for but still good 6/10</p>

<p>4. at number 4 we have Pokemon Scarlet/Violet a very big title for pokemon fans witha massive open world where there is no order to what you do and when, you could challange the hardest gym leader with a level five starter and a dream 
you could also get a max level team before you even fight your rival, go shiny hunting (most likely failing a few in the process) but no matter what its up to you. however after youve beaten the main story, DLC and grinded hundreds of 
shinys theres not much else to do other than start a new save file. 8/10

<p>3. At number 3 its a tough choice but im going with The Legend of Zelda Breath of The Wild. arguably one of or the best Zelda game of all time but in my opinion it was great but got overtaken by others.
You can get overpowered weapons to fight a helpless bokoblin or fight the final boss with a stick, you can speedrun in 8 minutes or cruise slowly and appreciate the game but all in all the game gets a 9/10 from me.

<p>2. At  number 2 we have Pokemon Legends Arceus. By far my favourite Pokemon of all time, it explores the journey of a Sinnoh trainer being teleported far back in time to a village where you are an outsider and need to join a corps to be allowed to live there. but a lot of stuff happens. You can explore the world and shiny hunting can be very fun but sometimes a little slow

<p>1. In first place i am putting The Legend of Zelda Tears of The Kingdom. the game after BOTW, TOTK, it far surpassed BOTW as it brought a map that is about 3X the size of breath of the wild. it also brought much more freedom and a few more glitches but was easily the best open world game on the Nintendo Switch. 10/10!
