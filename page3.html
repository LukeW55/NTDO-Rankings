<h1> Best Games 2D platformers on Nintendo Switch </h1>    

<p>We'll be counting down our Top Five Best 2D Platformers in our opinion at least</p>

<p>5. At number five i am going to put Donkey kong country. Now some might not call this a 2D platformer bur i do and i didnt really love it as it got kind of dull a while into it but in my opinion its quite bad. 5/10 </p>

<p>4.  At number four im going to put Mario Wonder. The game had a decent story and the multiplayer was nice but overall i feel like when playing as mario you are essentially playing how you should but most levels were made with kids using yoshi in mind rather than mario. Some levels were un-neccasarily hard. 6/10.</p>  <p/>

<p>3.  At number Three we have hollow knight. now i know i know this game is amazing but I havent played much amd I'm sure i will like it the more i play but until then its here (after i wrote this and played more so now its a 9/10 it was a 7/10 before). its a great game where you play to explore a place and fight hard bosses and tricky parkor. 9/10 

<p>2.  At number two we have kirby's return to dream land ultra deluxe. i loved the story i loved the minigames and i love the boss fights and the way you can do them in so many ways with different power ups. i also loed the fact that you had a whole mario party worth of minigames that can even get you main story game rewards. 9.5/10 </p>

<p>1.  At number one we have Metroid Dread. I was a little sceptical when it released but i beleive that it was one of the best purchases of my life as it gave me hours of story with some tricky jumps and tricks !minor spoiler! and some hard to kill E.M.M.i droids with a lot of strategy needed and precice timing. and it was an absolute treat to play and try dread mode even though there is a ZERO percent chance im beating that. 10/10
